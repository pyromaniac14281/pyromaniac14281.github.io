# Week 4 homework assignment:
### Crystals Collector Game

* This is a guessing game using numbers where the player will guess with numbers.
* There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
* The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
* When the player clicks on a crystal it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
* The player wins the game if their total score matches the random number and the player loses the game if their total score goes above the random number.
* The amount of points each crystal adds is not shown to the player, but their total score is displayed and updated after each crystal is clicked.
* The number of games won and lost will be displayed.
* If the player successfully matches their total score to the random number they get 1 win, if the player's total score is above the random number the player get 1 loss, either way the game restarts.
* When the game is restarted, the player will be shown a new random number, all the crystals will now have 4 different hidden values, and the player's total score is reset to 0.

#### Game design note:

###### The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120

###### Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12
